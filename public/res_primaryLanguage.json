      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jelani R. I'm working with newest front-end frameworks like React and Vue. I am an aspiring software developer. I always had an interest in technology and began to teach myself some basic programming when I was 13. After high school, I knew I wanted to continue coding. I enjoyed creating my own CS projects and wanted more tools in my arsenal to make bigger, better applications. I pursued computer science at both the University of Washington and the University of Texas but found college was not for me at the time, so I'm taking a software development certification bootcamp. Some of my greatest strengths are my attention to detail, thinking critically, problem solving, listening, and being reliable. I am also very self-motivated and have a lot of perseverance. In the future, I envision myself full-stack web developing and publishing mobile applications that can be released both in the Google Play store and the App Store. Maybe one day also assisting young women of color in their learning of computer science to help close the gender and diversity gap in the field and inspire more coders. ðŸ’œ",
